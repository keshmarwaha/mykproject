  <body>
    <!-- The way you want to think about this is a div is a container, so if you're going to add a class/id to a container,
         make sure it styles the container, rather than the h1 inside it. 
         This is fine for small things like this and does 
         work, but it gets a bit hard to understand when the project grows. 
        so a div would have styling like padding, display flex, background color, border etc.

        Ideal structure would be:
        <div class='title-container'>
            <h1 class="title">MYKONOS</h1>
        </div>  
     -->
    <div id="title">
      <h1><span class="underline">MYKONOS</span></h1>
      <!-- We don't need the span inside a h1, a span would only be used if you wanted two 
        things inline inside the H1, say an icon and text, so they sat beside each other. -->
    </div>

    <!-- a p4 isn't a HTML tag, think you might have meant h4, but in this case a p (paragraph) 
        is fine here, and for other paragraphs on the site. Typically you'd have multiple p tags
         on a page and if they had different styling, give them different classes. You never 
         really directly style a html tag (h1, p, div) directly since they'll be reused so 
         much it might have unintended consequences, if you wanted to add styles you would add 
         a class  -->

      >Mykonos is known as the Greek party island – but it’s much more than
      that! As a member of the Cycladic island group, Mykonos boasts stunning
      beaches, boutique shopping, whitewashed buildings, luxury hotels, and
      vibrant beach clubs and nightlife.</p4

    <h2>Here are the top 3 spots on the island of Mykonos!</h2>

    <!-- i'd give a more descriptive class name here e.g. "image-container" -->
    <div class="image">
      <img src="images/ornos.jpg" />
      <img src="images/town.jpeg" />
      <img src="images/platys.jpg" />
    </div>

    <!--  same here, "location-containers" -->
    <div class="names">
      <p1> ORNOS BEACH </p1>
      <p2>MYKONOS TOWN </p2>
      <p3>PLATIS GIALOS</p3>
      <!-- these should all be h3, or p tags -->
    </div>

    <div class="describe">
        <!-- these should all be p tags with classes to style them -->
        <!-- <p class="p5"> ... </p> is fine -->
      <p5
        >Ornos is one of the most popular beaches on Mykonos, located just 3km
        from Mykonos Town. Easy to get to by public bus, it’s a great choice for
        families.
      </p5>

      <P6
        >Mykonos Town is ideal for travelers who want the island’s best
        nightlife, dining, and shopping. As the transportation hub of the
        island, the town makes a fantastic base to explore.</P6
      >

      <p7
        >Platis Gialos is the best beach on Mykonos, roughly 5km southeast of
        the town. Beautiful with many restaurants, cafes, mini-markets, jet skis
        and other water sports rentals, and also many excellent hotels.</p7

<!-- Good work lad, v good, for the design i'd add a max-width to your p4, it's v long, 
    typically you'd want about 60 characters per line -->
<!-- And for your paragraphs under the images, same again, add some more padding to 
    either side so they've got some breathing room and aren't so close -->
